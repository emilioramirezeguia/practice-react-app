I'm recreating a version of the home page on [Airbnb Cereal](https://airbnb.design/cereal/) to practice fetching data from an API, passing data to custom components and styling them using styled-components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
